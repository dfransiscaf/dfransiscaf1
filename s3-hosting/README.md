# ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting & Notifications with Amazon S3

## üìù Overview

Create and configure an **Amazon S3 bucket** to share images with an external user at a media company (`mediacouser`) who has been hired to provide pictures of the products that the caf√© sells. The S3 bucket is configured to **automatically send an email notification** to the administrator whenever the bucket contents are modified.  

## üîß Tools & Technologies

* **Amazon S3** 
* **Amazon SNS** 
* **AWS IAM** 
* **AWS CLI**

1. **Connecting to the CLI Host EC2 instance and configuring the AWS CLI**

   * Connected to an EC2 instance (CLI Host).
   * Configured AWS CLI with `aws configure` using **mediacouser** credentials.

2. **Creating and initializing the S3 share bucket**

3. **Reviewing and Testing the IAM group and user permissions**

   * Checked IAM group *mediaco* and user *mediacouser*.
   * Verified that mediacouser could **upload** and **delete** objects but could **not change bucket permissions**.

4. **Configuring event notifications on the S3 share bucket**

   * Created an SNS topic `s3NotificationTopic`.
   * Subscribed admin email to receive notifications.
   * Added event notification on the bucket for **ObjectCreated** and **ObjectRemoved**.
